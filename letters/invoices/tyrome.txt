Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Tyrome's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

$1000  Kaleidoscope
$1000  Bear
$1000  Monopoly
$1000  Twister
$1000  Uno
$1000  Truck

$6000  Subtotal
$780.0   HST
====
$6780.0  Total

Your total comes to $6780.0. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Tyrome's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
